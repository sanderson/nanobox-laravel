## Explore

With Nanobox, you don't have to have anything installed on your machine to run your app:

```bash
# drop into a Nanobox console
nanobox run

# where laravel is installed,
php -v

# your packages are available,
composer show

# and your code is mounted
ls
```

## What Does This Quickstart Do?
When Nanobox starts, it will run the quickstart install script as part of the build process which does the following:

1. Downloads the Laravel Installer
2. Installs the latest version of Laravel
3. Updates database credentials in the `.env` file with environment variables auto-generated by Nanobox
4. Creates a `.env.prod` for use in a live app

For the full details, take a look at [`quickstart/install.sh`](quickstart/install.sh).

### Using Other Databases
By default, the quickstart only provides a MySQL database but configs for Postgres and Redis are both included in the `boxfile.yml`. To use add either one to your app, uncomment the entries in your `boxfile.yml`. If using Postgres, be sure to update the following in your `.env` and `.env.prod`.

```txt
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=$DATA_POSTGRES_HOST
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=gonano
DB_USERNAME=$DATA_POSTGRES_USER
DB_PASSWORD=$DATA_POSTGRES_PASS
```

Run `nanobox run` to rebuild your app with the new data components.
